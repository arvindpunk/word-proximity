        <h1>Word Edit | Privacy Policy</h1>
        Word Edit is a closed source Android app developed by Arvind PJ inspired by the recent popularity of Word based
        games. The app is also available on Google Play. As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy extremely seriously.
        
        I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any
        personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like game state stats, etc.)) created by you (the
        user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No user
        collected data is sent to the game servers.
        

        The following permissions are enabled for this game:
        <ol>
            <li><b>android.permission.INTERNET</b> - This permissions is only used to get and validate the user input word guess.</li>
        </ol>
        If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how
        the app protects your privacy, please reach out to me via email.
